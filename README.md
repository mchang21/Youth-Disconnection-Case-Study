# Youth Disconnection Case Study

This is a group project for COGS 137 - Practical Data Science in R

## Introduction 

In this case study, we seek to analyze the youth disconnection among minority groups within the United States. The disconnected youth are the young people who are between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither working nor in school. Following the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2008, we witnessed a peak youth disconnection rate of 14.7 percent in 2010 which has since been trending downwards to as low as a youth disconnection rate of 11.5 percent in 2017. While analyzing racial and ethnic groups is imperative for viewing any evident disparities, we also intend on analyzing how gender may play a role in affecting the rates of disconnection. Seeing as how we can already see existing disparities between genders within the workforce, we also want to see to what extent, if at all, gender plays a role in youth disconnection among groups. 

This specific period of young adulthood is one of the most critical in developing the necessary skills and capabilities required of them to be successful in adulthood and their professional careers as youth disconnection during this period stunts development and limits their potential. Measure of America, a nonpartisan project of the nonprofit Social Science Research, claims that "people who experience a period of disconnection as young adults go on to earn less and are less likely to be employed, own a home, or report good health by the time they reach their thirties‚Äù. Understanding how these trends among groups arise may be critical for finding solutions to preventing youth disconnection, and analyzing what groups may need more resources in order to prevent further prevent youth disconnection. 

## Task

Analyze trends among groups that may be critical for finding solutions to preventing youth disconnection, and analyzing what groups may need more resources in order to prevent further prevent youth disconnection.

## Questions

1. How have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008?
2. In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected?
3. Does removing 2008 (pre-Great Recession time period) data points change our answer?

## Data Set

The data set that we will be using for our case study is provided by two reports from the Measure of America project related to youth disconnect. The data provided will be in the form of images.
